## Description

This project aims to bring complete ray tracing support for Minecraft's default resources in a manner that seamlessly integerates with the game while maintaining a native look and feel.

- **[Vanilla RTX:](https://mcpedl.com/vanilla-rtx)** Uses 16x heightmaps with 192x normal maps generated based on height differences.  
- **[Vanilla RTX Normals:](https://mcpedl.com/vanilla-rtx-normals)** Features handcrafted 16x normal maps instead.
- Every possible vanilla block is supported (Creative, Education Edition, secret or unobtainable blocks, etc...)  
- All blocks feature highly detailed, unique material designs that remain consistent across different blocks made of similar materials.
- Compatibility errors of vanilla resources with ray tracing are resolved through the Enhanced option as much as possible. (accessed from resource pack's settings)
- Related Projects:
  - **[Vanilla RTX Tuner](https://github.com/Cubeir/Vanilla-RTX-Tuner):** An installable tool that lets you adjust fog, lighting & materials in Vanilla RTX, with automated package updates and more...
  - **Vanilla RTX Opus:** Composition of both Vanilla RTX & Vanilla RTX Normals. (Coming along soon!)
  - **[Chemistry RTX Extensions:](https://mcpedl.com/chemistry-rtx/)** Additional world-only resource packs to add ray tracing support to the content available under Minecraft: Education Edition toggle.
  - **[Vanilla Vibrant Visuals:](https://mcpedl.com/vanilla-pbr)** A branch of Vanilla RTX for Vibrant Visuals graphics mode usable on a wider range of hardware.

Initial goal of this project was to create a fresh Bedrock Edition equivalent of [Vanilla Normals Renewed](https://github.com/Poudingue/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed). This effort later evolved into Vanilla RTX Normals.  
Vanilla RTX now strives to provide an ideal default Minecraft RTX experience for all Bedrock Edition players.

## Usage Tips
- For Installation: Each folder in this repository is a complete package. To import one, download and extract the whole repo, compress either ibe of the folders `Vanilla RTX` or `Vanilla RTX Normals` into a `.zip` file, rename the `.zip` extension to `.mcpack`, then open it with Minecraft to import.  
Note: [Vanilla RTX Tuner App](https://github.com/Cubeir/Vanilla-RTX-Tuner) automates this process, so you can easily keep the pack updated for the latest version of the game.

- Activation issues: There is a problem that will keep Vanilla RTX from loading and could make the world appear glossy. To prevent this, ray tracing must be enabled before joining a world. However since Minecraft 1.21.60, ray tracing can only be initially toggled while inside a world.  
Workaround: While in the main menu, head to video settings, turn on `Allow In-Game Graphics Mode Switching` then join any world, enable ray tracing from the dropdown graphics mode menu in video settings (you may experience issues at first), now exit to the main menu and rejoin. Once ray tracing is enabled, do not turn it off to prevent this issue from occurring again.
For simplicity, use the [Vanilla RTX Tuner App](https://github.com/Cubeir/Vanilla-RTX-Tuner) to launch the game through the 'Launch Minecraft RTX' button which activates ray tracing before Minecraft is launched. (Recommended while [MCPE-191513](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE/issues/MCPE-191513) and [MCPE-121850](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE/issues/MCPE-121850) persist).

- If you're experiencing performance issues, [disable Minecraft's VSync](https://youtu.be/CKK1VSbGGnk), you can keep VSync on in your graphics card's control panel. This also reduces input latency when compared to Minecraft's VSync. (VSync is automatically disabled by the Vanilla RTX Tuner App while [MCPE-121850](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE/issues/MCPE-121850) persists)

- If you've encountered visual bugs (such as some textures exhibiting z-fighting issues, or entities with missing or black textures) try switching to Enhanced option included in Vanilla RTX (Normals). This enables various features and updates that enhance visuals and work around some of ray tracing's technical incompatibilities with vanilla resources, but note that some of them may come with minor drawbacks when paired with other resource packs/add-ons. For an up-to-date list of features [visit this page](https://minecraftrtx.net/enhancements).

- It is recommended that you enable the pack in Global Resources instead of World resource packs, there's an issue in Minecraft that can create incomplete copies of resource pack's files when enabled in world settings.

- To ensure subpack changes are saved, you may need to apply the setting multiple times while [MCPE-162002](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE/issues/MCPE-162002) and [MCPE-229024](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE/issues/MCPE-229024) persist.

- If textures fail to load or appear to have issues, make sure that world, server or realm resource packs aren't overriding Vanilla RTX's files.

Reminder:  
Vanilla RTX and its derivative works are completely free to download and use. However be aware of unauthorized copies or versions of Vanilla RTX that may circulate, sometimes under different names and even for sale. These unauthorized copies may, at best, replicate the version available on this page.

Disclaimer:  
The license file linked above does not apply to any original Minecraft art resource.  
  
Please note that this pack relies on some of Minecraft's original art resources (found at [this github repository](https://aka.ms/resourcepacktemplate)) to function.
This is due to a game limitation where texture maps can only be called within the pack and once removed, the game stops defaulting to its own resources, contrary to the usual behavior of Minecraft texture packs. Consequently, Vanilla RTX unavoidably has to include a small part of base game's resources as referenced by ```texture_set.json``` files. As time passes this may result in outdated resources. Parity checks are performed on a regular basis with the pack adjusted accordingly.  
It is also worth noting large parts of vanilla resources also had to be modified for compatibility with ray tracing or to work around other technical issues or limitations without altering their original appearance. For instance, the Enhanced option which addresses a wide range of compatibility issues with Minecraft‚Äôs vanilla resources in ray tracing graphics mode, [learn more](https://minecraftrtx.net/enhancements).
