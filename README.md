# Vanilla-RTX-Normals

Vanilla RTX Normals is a Vanilla Based PBR Resource Pack for Minecraft RTX on Bedrock Edition.

⚠️ Windows 10 - Bedrock Edition +1.16.200 only ⚠️

## Description

Initial goal of creating this resource pack was having something similar to [Vanilla Normals Renewed](https://github.com/Poudingue/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed) for Bedrock Edition.

Vanilla RTX Normals takes Full advantage of per-pixel MERs, with two different subpacks, one focused on bringing 16x normal maps & the other uses 16x heightmaps (which are later converted to 128x normal maps by game to simulate depth), most of MERs (Metalic, Emissive, Roughness) are the same between subpacks, but there are minor differences because some simply didn't fit normals or vice versa. Vanilla RTX Normals covers every possible block in Vanilla game, even ones that you might never use or heard of, such as structure block or Education Edition blocks (e.g tables, Hard glass, Element blocks, Camera block etc...)

To switch to a different subpack (heightmaps are used by default):
1. After activating pack, click on it while in resource pack management window.
2. A gear icon appears, click on it.
3. You see an slider which allows you to switch between subpacks.

It's highly recommened to activate pack in global settings to prevent some possible issues such as resources not loading.
If you can trouble switching between subpacks, deactivate pack from global settings, reactivate it & try switching subpacks again & make sure you restart game after switching subpacks, sometimes it might take multiple attempts, deactivate pack and reactivate each time.
