# Vanilla-RTX

Vanilla RTX is a Vanilla Based PBR Resource Pack for Minecraft RTX on Bedrock Edition.

⚠️ Windows 10 - Bedrock Edition +1.16.200 Only ⚠️

## Description

Initial goal of creating this resource pack was having something similar to [Vanilla Normals Renewed](https://github.com/Poudingue/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed) for Bedrock Edition.

Vanilla RTX (Normals) takes full advantage of per-pixel MERs to get the maximum possible detail with full consistency, most of MERs (Metalic, Emissive, Roughness) are the same between subpacks, but there are minor differences because some simply didn't fit normals or vice versa, Vanilla-RTX uses 16x heightmaps which are later converted to 128x normal maps by game and Vanilla-RTX-Normals uses 16x normal maps.
Vanilla RTX also covers every possible block in Vanilla game, even ones that you might never use or heard of, such as structure block or Education Edition blocks (e.g tables, Hard glass, Element blocks, Camera block etc...)

Disclaimer: I do not own vanilla textures and most of them are taken from Minecraft (some of them are slightly edited by me to work properly with ray tracing, e.g glass)
entire point of this resource pack is adding other required PBR maps on top of vanilla game without altering vanilla aspects.
