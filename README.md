# Vanilla-RTX-Normals
Vanilla RTX Normals is a Vanilla Based resource pack for Minecraft RTX on Bedrock Edition.

⚠️ Windows 10 Devices - +1.16.200 only ⚠️

# Description
Initial goal of creating this resource pack was having something similar to [Vanilla Normals Renewed](https://github.com/Poudingue/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed) for Bedrock Edition
Vanilla RTX Normals takes Full advantage of Per-Pixel MERs, with two subpacks, One focused on bringing 16x Normal maps & the other uses 16x Heightmaps (which are later converted to 128x Normal maps by game to simulate depth), most of MERs (Metalic Emissive, Roughness) are the same between subpacks, but there are minor differences because some simply didn't fit normals or vice versa.
This pack supports Every possible block in Vanilla game, even ones that you might never use, such as Structure block or Education Edition blocks (e.g tables, hard glass, Element blocks etc...)
