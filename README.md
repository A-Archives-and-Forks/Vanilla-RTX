# Vanilla-RTX

Vanilla RTX is a Vanilla Based PBR Resource Pack for Minecraft RTX on Bedrock Edition.

⚠️ Windows 10/11 - Bedrock Edition +1.16.200 Only ⚠️

## Description

Vanilla RTX aims to bring complete ray tracing support for Minecraft's default resources while remaining faithful to all the different aspects and details of vanilla Minecraft.  
Initial goal of creating this resource pack was having something similar to [Vanilla Normals Renewed](https://github.com/Poudingue/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed) for Bedrock Edition.  

Vanilla RTX uses 16x heightmaps (later converted to 192x normal maps based on height differences) Vanilla RTX Normals uses 16x normal maps instead.  
Every possible vanilla block is covered (Creative, Education Edition, secret blocks, etc...)  
Everything is consistent & fine-tuned for Minecraft RTX.

## Copyright
[View License](https://github.com/CubeIR/Vanilla-RTX/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)  
Note that this pack relies on some of Minecraft's original art resources (found at [this github repository](https://github.com/Mojang/bedrock-samples/releases)) to function, this is because texture maps can only be called within the pack and once removed, the game will not use Minecraft's resources (which should be the behavior as is in other cases). Vanilla RTX is updated to include latest texture changes every few weeks to retain parity and PBR textures are updated according to the changes.
The license file linked above does not apply to Minecraft's original art resources.

Reminder: Vanilla RTX (Normals) is completely free to download and use, you might encounter reuploaded copies of Vanilla RTX or reuploaded variations of Vanilla RTX/Vanilla RTX Normals that are being sold & are at best the same version that is found on this page, it is often beyond my capability to combat this behavior, all I can is to sincerely ask you to avoid paying for a Minecraft resource pack that a quarter of it is Minecraft's original resources and majority of it an unauthorized copy of Vanilla RTX.

## Tip
If you're experiencing low frame rate, [disable Minecraft's VSync](https://youtu.be/E-gANUpoMus?t=12), you can keep VSync on in your graphics card control panel. This also helps reduce input latency when compared to Minecraft's VSync.
